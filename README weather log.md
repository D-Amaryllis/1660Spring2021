1/14/2021 It was cloudy this morning.
1/15/2021 25 degrees and sunny!
1/16/2021 32 degrees and mostly cloudy
1/17/2021 28 degrees and hazy.  I tried to get Maya yesterday so I could start practicing with it, but I accidentally used my prefered name instead of my legal name.  They want me to prove my identity with documents that don't exist so...I'm gonna hope the library has Maya so that I can at least try it out while this gets worked out.  Sigh.
